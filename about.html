<p>I am a Masters in Information Systems student at University of Cincinnati. I am currently interning at SAP as part of my co-op.</p>
<p>During my first semester vacation, I was pretty free and I started exploring Coursera's Data Science Specialization and found R pretty simple to use
and the world of Data Science very interesting. In the next few months, I have gradually spent time learning more and more through online courses and projects. 
When I was in India for my summer break, I explored some options to get a portfolio of projects under my belt and it led me to register for 
Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. I am now comfortable using Python, R and SAS. I have got myself certified in SAS too.</p>
<p>I feel that I am currently ready to take a full time position as a Data Analyst/Scientist in a firm, help the firm make better
decisions using their data and grow even further in this field. You can take a look at <a href="/projects">some of my projects here.</a></p>
